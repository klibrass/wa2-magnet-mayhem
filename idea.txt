- panorama (parallax)
- just a simple game involving physics
    - a round where you have to attract things to you but some of those things minus your points
    - a round with water (drag)
    - a round with ice 
- gravity system
- camera system (this will be hard to implement)
- ACTUAL imagery
| Element                  | How it helps                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Moving platform**      | Forces timing of magnet placement |
| **Limited magnet count** | Forces smart planning             |
| **Magnet timer / decay** | Can't spam forever                |


i think this is way too ambitious but it gives me context to work with lol

idea
- 8 round prelim
- 10 rounds to collect additional magnet fun
- simulation at the end
